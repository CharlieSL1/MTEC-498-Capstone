    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Current music creation/performance tools for spatial audio are either **too technical** (post-production/DAW-bound) or **too experimental** (unreliable gestures, weak integration). Musicians lack an **intuitive, real-time** way to treat sound as a **tangible object** that can be positioned and **performed** in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creative Vision\n",
    "Build a platform that makes sound feel **grabbable**. Combine a **pan controller** with a **wearable hexagonal MIDI interface** so musicians can first **select 3D positions** and then **perform** them—transforming spatial audio from an engineering task into a **new instrument**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance\n",
    "Spatial audio is expanding across **gaming, VR/AR, film, and live music**. Tools lag in **accessibility** and **playability**. This project bridges **cutting-edge spatialization** with **embodied performance**, offering an **intuitive, expressive** path into immersive sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Personal Connection\n",
    "As a **composer–technologist**, I feel the gap between **imagined spatial sound** and **cumbersome tooling**. This project aims to **collapse that gap**—making spatial design as immediate as **strumming a chord** or **hitting a drum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Users & Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Users\n",
    "Musicians, producers, sound artists, and audiences exploring **new performance formats**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "- **Studio**: Rapidly test spatial effects during composition/production.  \n",
    "- **Live Performance**: Use as an **expressive instrument** for immersive shows.  \n",
    "- **Art Exhibitions**: Let audiences **intuitively interact** with spatial audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Needs\n",
    "**Intuitive control**, **real-time feedback**, and **low learning barriers**—turning spatial audio from complex tooling into an **accessible performance medium**.\n",
