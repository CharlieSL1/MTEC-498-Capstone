## 🎯 Project Summary

**PanGu** is a next-generation spatial audio performance platform that transforms spatial audio into an expressive instrument for composition and live performance. Using depth camera tracking and gesture recognition, performers can intuitively position and manipulate sounds in 3D space in real-time.

### Key Features
- **Real-time 3D Position Tracking**: OAK-D Pro depth camera provides accurate XYZ coordinates
- **Gesture Recognition**: MediaPipe-based system recognizes 6 gesture types (Open Palm, Closed Fist, Pointing Up, Victory, Thumb Up, Thumb Down)
- **OSC Communication**: Seamless integration with Max/MSP and Ableton Live
- **Max for Live Integration**: Custom `PanGu.amxd` device for direct DAW control
- **Low Latency**: <20ms round-trip latency for performance-ready responsiveness
