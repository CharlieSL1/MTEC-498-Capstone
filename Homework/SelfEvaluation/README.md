## Project Summary
**PanGu — Spatial Audio, Live Phase Controller & Composition Assistant**

A next-generation spatial audio performance platform featuring a wearable, arm-mounted Circle MIDI controller that enables musicians to select positions in 3D space and instantly play/place sounds there—transforming spatial audio into an expressive instrument for composition and live performance.

## Key Achievements
- Developed gesture recognition system using MediaPipe
- Implemented OSC communication between Python and Max/MSP
- Created modular system architecture for spatial audio control
- Integrated computer vision with real-time audio processing
- Built comprehensive documentation and project structure

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming (MediaPipe, OpenCV, OSC)
- Max/MSP integration and audio processing
- Computer vision and gesture recognition
- System architecture and modular design
- Documentation and project management

## Learning Outcomes Assessment
This self-evaluation will assess achievement across all course learning outcomes with specific evidence from the PanGu project development.
